      <description>The first assigment for the SLAE64 certification asks to write a TCP Bind Shell shellcode that listens on a port and then executes a shell after verifying a &amp;ldquo;passcode&amp;rdquo; on successful connection.
For the basic structure of a Bind Shell TCP, please refer to assignment 5 and to related assignment for the SLAE32 certification.
In order to verify the passcode, a code section has been added after the dup2 cycle, in order to perform a read syscall which puts the 8 bytes read on the stack and compares with the hardcoded passcode (acceptme).</description>

      <description>The second assigment for the SLAE64 certification asks to write a TCP Reverse Shell shellcode that connects to an address and a port and then executes a shell after verifying a &amp;ldquo;passcode&amp;rdquo; on successful connection.
For the basic structure of a Reverse Shell TCP, please refer to assignment 5 and to related assignment for the SLAE32 certification.
In order to verify the passcode, a code section has been added after the dup2 cycle, in order to perform a read syscall which puts the 8 bytes read on the stack and compares with the hardcoded passcode (acceptme).</description>

      <description>The fifth assigment for the SLAE64 certification asks to choose 3 shellcode samples created with Msfpayload for linux/x86_64 and dissect them presenting the analysis.
The list of available shellcodes have been generated using the following command:
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Labs/SLAE64/Assignment-5] └─$ msfvenom --list payloads | grep linux/x64 &amp;gt; List_Payloads_Linux-x64.txt Bind TCP The first shellcode I have selected is linux/x64/shell_bind_tcp.
First of all, we need to understand which parameters this shellcode needs:
┌──(kali㉿kali)-[~/Labs/SLAE64/Assignment-5/5.1-ShellBindTcp] └─$ msfvenom -p linux/x64/shell_bind_tcp --list-options Options for payload/linux/x64/shell_bind_tcp: ========================= Name: Linux Command Shell, Bind TCP Inline Module: payload/linux/x64/shell_bind_tcp Platform: Linux Arch: x64 Needs Admin: No Total size: 86 Rank: Normal Provided by: ricky Basic options: Name Current Setting Required Description ---- --------------- -------- ----------- LPORT 4444 yes The listen port RHOST no The target address Description: Listen for a connection and spawn a command shell For the sake of diversity, I selected port 5555, therefore the shellcode generation is done with the following command:</description>
